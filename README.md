# CodesMasterThesis
Here one can find the MATLAB codes used for the computation of the numerical results presented in the work "On the dispersive behaviour of hyperbolic systems in periodic media" by Giuseppe Virgilio Minissale and the thesis itself.
In particular:
-Using the MATLAB code named PetKdv.m one can compute the travelling wave for the KdV equation using the Petviashvili-type method described in the thesis;
-Using the MATLAB code named Petviashvili_Euler_order_3.m one can compute an accurate approximation of the travelling wave for the homogezined Euler system of order three using the Petviashvili-type method described in the thesis;
-Using the MATLAB code named Petviashvili_Euler_order_5.m one can compute an accurate approximation of the travelling wave for the homogezined Euler system of order five using the Petviashvili-type method described in the thesis;
-Using the MATLAB code named ConsSW.m one can compute the conserved quantity for the homogenized 1D Shallow water equations described in the thesis;
-Using the MATLAB code named ConsSW.m one can compute the conserved quantity for the homogenized 2D Shallow water equations described in the thesis.
